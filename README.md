# CSS3 Animation 

CSS animation can animate various CSS properties like color, height, position, and so on. Pure CSS animation works perfectly without JavaScript or media (e.g. GIFs), everything can be completed with HTML and CSS only.

Recently I created a video about CSS animation and to explain the topic, I used a website as a reference.
